+ Incorporate benchmark code
- Try GPU acceleration
- Allow for transport processes other than classical diffusion.
+ Support default parameters as defined with `@parameters a=2.0` etc.
+ Access solutions by species rather than integer index.
+ Don't rely on consistant order of species.
- Accept parameter values given as integers.
- Use LaTeX to label plots.
- Normalise plots by range instead of norm
+ Combine time series and interactive plots.
- Add output expressions combining species.
- Add per species noise level to @initial_conditions
- Add x variable to tutorial.
- Move noise level to @initial_conditions.
- Make parameter set vectors and parameter ranges for interactive plotting the same objects (somehow).
- stop plots resizing as limits change.
- use @debug for output such as repeated attempts.
